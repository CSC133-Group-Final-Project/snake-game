# Core Gameplay Mechanics

## Adaptive Difficulty
- The game's difficulty adjusts in real-time based on the player's performance, analyzing player behavior and tweaking the game accordingly.

## Multiple Snake Types
- Players can choose from various snake types, each with unique abilities. For example:
  - Some snakes may be able to go through walls.
  - Others can move faster.
  - Some can temporarily freeze time.

## Power-Ups and Abilities
- Introduce power-ups such as speed boosts, shields, or score multipliers.
- Each snake has a cooldown-based special ability, like a dash move or the ability to go through its own tail for a short period.

## Interactive Environments
- Levels feature obstacles and interactive elements that can change the game, like movable blocks, portals, or areas that alter the snake's speed.

## Dynamic Levels
- The arena changes shape and size as the game progresses, requiring players to adapt to new environments strategically.

# Visual and Audio Enhancements

## High-Definition Graphics
- Upgrade to modern, sleek graphics, with a range of visual themes for the snake and environment, from neon cyberpunk to lush jungles.

## Responsive Soundtrack
- Implement a dynamic soundtrack that reflects the gameplay, growing more intense as the game progresses.

## Haptic Feedback
- Provide physical feedback through haptic support on mobile or controllers to further immerse players.

# Social and Competitive Features

## Multiplayer Modes
- Support competitive multiplayer in an arena, or cooperative modes for navigating challenging levels. (This may be out of scope.)

## Leaderboards and Tournaments
- Keep the competitive scene active with monthly leaderboards and online tournaments, rewarding top players.

## Social Sharing
- Enable players to share high scores, favorite moments, or custom-created levels directly to social media platforms.

# Player Engagement

## Daily Challenges
- Offer new challenges daily, rewarding players with in-game items or currency.

## Achievements and Badges
- Reward players for completing specific challenges and milestones with a system of achievements and badges.

# Project Structure - Design Patterns

## Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM)
- **Model:** Handles the business logic and data, including classes like `Snake`, `FoodItem`, and `GameBoard`.
- **View:** Responsible for rendering game objects and detecting user input. In Android, this involves `Activity`, `Fragment`, and custom `View` classes.
- **ViewModel:** Serves as an intermediary between the View and the Model, exposing data streams and handling user interaction logic.

## Singleton
- **GameEngine:** Manages the game loop and state as a single instance.

## Factory
- **GameObjectFactory:** Creates instances of game objects, allowing for easy feature modifications and extensions.

## Observer
- **LiveData:** Observes changes in game state within the MVVM architecture, updating the UI as necessary.

## Strategy
- **MovementStrategy:** Defines algorithms for snake movement, changeable based on the game's state.
- **AudioStrategy:** Manages everything sound-related.

## Command
- **InputHandler:** Encapsulates input actions for potential undo operations or replay functionality.

## Repository
- **GameRepository:** Provides a clean API for data operations and abstracts data access details.

## Decorator
- **PowerUpDecorator:** Adds new behaviors to game objects dynamically.

## Adapter
- **ViewAdapter:** Converts data models into viewable items for components like RecyclerViews.

## State
- **GameState:** Manages transitions between various game states (PlayingState, PausedState, GameOverState) and dictates game behavior.
